/**
 * A class that encapsulates the error messages being reported by the validate()
 * method of a Aloi_Phruts_Action_Form.
 * 
 * <p>Validation errors are either global to the entire Aloi_Phruts_Action_Form bean
 * they are associated with, or they are specific to a particular bean property
 * (and, therefore, a particular input field on the corresponding form).</p>
 * <p>Each individual error is described by an Aloi_Phruts_Action_Error object, which
 * contains a message key (to be looked up in an appropriate message resources
 * database), and up to four placeholder arguments used for parametric
 * substitution in the resulting message.</p>
